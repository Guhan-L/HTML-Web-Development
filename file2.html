    <p>
    HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It serves as the fundamental building block for all webpages, defining the layout and organization of information displayed in web browsers. 
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: darkslategray;">Markup Language</h2>
   Markup Language: HTML utilizes a system of "tags" and "elements" to structure content. These tags provide instructions to a web browser on how to display text, images, links, and other multimedia elements.
Elements and Attributes: HTML documents are composed of elements, each representing a specific part of the document (e.g., a paragraph, a heading, an image). Elements are defined by opening and closing tags (e.g., <p> and </p> for a paragraph). Attributes, written within the opening tag, provide additional information or modify the behavior of an element (e.g., src attribute for an image, href attribute for a link).
